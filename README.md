# 🎄 Gesture-Controlled Particle Christmas Tree

An interactive digital Christmas card where a Christmas tree is **created and animated using hand gestures**.
Your hands don’t click buttons — they *bring the tree to life*.

## What it is

This project is a **gesture-controlled particle system** that transforms into a Christmas tree.

- Open palm → particles float freely  
- Closed fist → particles converge into a Christmas tree  
- Subtle hand movement → organic, living motion  

No controllers. No clicks.  
Just your hands.

## How it works (at a glance)

- Real-time **hand gesture detection via webcam**
- A **particle system** that reacts continuously to gesture state
- Smooth transitions between chaos ↔ structure
- Designed as a **playful digital Christmas card experience**

## Why this exists

Most digital cards are static.
This one feels *alive*.

It’s designed to:
- Turn a greeting into a moment
- Feel magical without instructions
- Work as both a demo and a gift

Perfect for:
- Digital Christmas cards
- Interactive greetings
- Gesture-based creative experiments
